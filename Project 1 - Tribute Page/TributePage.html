                    <p id="tribute-info">Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist. Einstein is known for
                        developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development
                        of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two
                        pillars of modern physics. His massâ€“energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from
                        relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921
                        Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his
                        discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum
                        theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous
                        with "genius".</p>
